This repository contains all of the ansible playbooks that I have created. Most of this code was created at my job for automating functions in order to make it easier on the IT administrator as well as the end user. All code posted here has been signed off by my company and personal data has been removed. If you were to copy this code, you will have to change some of the variables to suit your enviroment.
